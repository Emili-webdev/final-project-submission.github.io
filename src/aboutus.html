      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <h2>Our story</h2>
      
        <p>Once upon a time, in the vibrant city of Vancouver, a delightful tale unfolded when a German-Italian couple, fueled by their love for authentic pizza, decided to embark on a culinary adventure. After relocating from the bustling streets of London, they found themselves craving the flavors they had grown to adore, only to discover that their beloved pizza varieties were nowhere to be found in their new home.</p>

        <p>Undeterred, Anja and Matteo rolled up their sleeves and embraced the challenge, determined to bring their cherished recipes to life. With a dash of passion and a sprinkle of determination, they opened the doors to their very own pizza haven in 2022. </p>
        <p>Ever since then, the aroma of freshly baked dough and tantalizing toppings has wafted through the air of the West End, beckoning pizza enthusiasts from near and far. </p>

            <h2>Making some serious dough</h2>

            <p>Pizza dough is serious business. </p>
            <p>Having great quality dough is crucial for making delicious pizza. The dough serves as the foundation, and its texture, flavor, and ability to hold toppings depend on the ingredients and preparation methods used.</p>
            <p>A well-crafted dough elevates the overall taste and experience of the pizza. We offer four different, hand crafted types. Each one is made with love and care, using only the finest ingredients. </p>
